# Industry-Lab
This a repository based on a college project.
The goal is to predict a parameter.

Next steps:
1) improve preprocessing: probably transform variables' distribution (ex. log(X)), verify univariate outliers, probably remove bivariate outliers, probably add data scaling if useful for ML algorithms
2) add a model able to identify new data as outlier: autoencoder or isolation forest
3) verify that the leakage coefficient calculation is correct: actually, we set an efficiency of 95%
4) develop models to predict the leakage coefficient value: regression and/or clustering
5) answer to the questions in power point presentation
6) write the project presentation
7) delivery the project before 15th June
